# Combat Details

Add-On Module for Foundry VTT

This is a small module I created to open a notification that the players turn is next, or that it's their turn.
Based on the Combat Ready! module.  I'm just learning how to write code for Foundry VTT.

## Known issue/Limitation
## Installation

It's always easiest to install modules from the in game add-on browser.

To install this module manually:
1.  Inside the Foundry "Configuration and Setup" screen, click "Add-on Modules"
2.  Click "Install Module"
3.  In the "Manifest URL" field, paste the following url:
`https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ironmonk88/combatdetails/master/src/module.json`
4.  Click 'Install' and wait for installation to complete
5.  Don't forget to enable the module in game using the "Manage Module" button

### libWrapper

This module uses the [libWrapper](https://github.com/ruipin/fvtt-lib-wrapper) library for wrapping core methods. It is a hard dependency and it is recommended for the best experience and compatibility with other modules.
